## Era of Big data : Personalized/Precision medicine 

- Amount of DATA.

- 

many ... many ... too ... many missing values 


## 

- Phenotyping (make good labels)

- 








## History of Human genome

* Watson & Crick

* Sequencing

ref :

## current knowledge about human genome

* Hapmap & g1k population.
* 80 % variations are single nucleotide variation.
* 

## current knowledge about human genome and Traits.

* GWAS catalog ????

## Missing Heritability

$$ Missig h^2 = \hat{h}^{2}_{pedigree} - \hat{h}^{2}_{stat}$$

## current project

- Colon cancer susceptibility 


## Current limitation :

- role of `common` variation in ~~~.
-
-

## Genomic signals we have.

- population signal *most largest signal.

**Principle Component analysis**

- Clustering of ~~

**t-SNE clustering of the population**
- 

**k-Nearleast neighbor method on Chromosome 22.**
- 97% accurately predict superpopulation

## Common traits

- Height

- Body mass index (Weight)

## DATA science.

- The Era of Big data.

- Traditional ~~~ does not account for the ~~~.

- Height; 


## DATA level

* Central Dogma and

  DNA -> mRNA -> protein -> function
 
  -our genomic data has 3 layers.

*

# GWAS

* Gene-set enrichment assay.


## EDGC Service 

- NICE

* Predict fetal genomic defects from fetal fraction.


# Session 2 : my project and ~~~.


## Disease Prediction

**Cancer**

**SLE**

**Asthma**

**Korean Colon Cancer**

## Pharmacogenomics



## k-NN or TCGA samples

## Drug Adverse Effects (ongoing)

- **HIV** drug : navapine.
- supportvector machine on SNPs.
- 85% of adverse effect generated by ~~~ is detected by the algorithm.

## Systemic Lupus Erithro~~~.


## Phenotyping,

* current ~~ is based on the ~~~, not molecular level.
